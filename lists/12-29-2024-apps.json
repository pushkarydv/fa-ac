CA resident license #0172748.<br><br>ELIGIBILITY AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS; PERSONAL LOAN INTEREST RATES AND FEES. You can see personal loan offers on the Credit Karma personal loan marketplace from third party advertisers from which Credit Karma receives compensation. Credit Karma members are shown offers with Outstanding Approval Odds^ when available to them. Offers with Outstanding Approval Odds have rates that range from 3.86% APR to 35.99% APR with terms from 1 to 10 years. Rates are subject to change without notice and are controlled by our third party advertisers, not Credit Karma. Depending on the particular lender, other fees may apply, such as origination fees or late payment fees. See the particular lender&#39;s terms and conditions for additional details. All loan offers on Credit Karma require your application and approval by the lender. You may not qualify for a personal loan at all or you may not qualify for the lowest rates or the highest offer amounts.\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>PERSONAL LOAN REPAYMENT EXAMPLE. The following example assumes a $15,000 personal loan with a four year (48 month) term. For APRs ranging from 3.86% to 35.99%, monthly payments would range from $338 to $594. Assuming all of the 48 payments are made on-time, the total amount paid would range from $16,212 to $28,492.<br><br>^ Approval Odds are not a guarantee of approval. Credit Karma determines Approval Odds by comparing your credit profile to other Credit Karma members who were approved for the personal loan, or whether you meet certain criteria determined by the lender. Of course, there&#39;s no such thing as a sure thing, but knowing your Approval Odds may help you narrow down your choices. For example, you may not be approved because you don&#39;t meet the lender&#39;s &quot;ability to pay standard&quot; after they verify your income and employment; or, you already have the maximum number of accounts with that specific lender.",

The lender gives you a small amount that you must repay in full on or just after you next receive your wages. This comes with a fee on top, or what you&#39;d typically call interest.<br><br>A payday loan is an excellent way of covering those unforeseen bills or unbudgeted purchases that you&#39;d usually have to wait until payday to cover. <br><br>What makes the Borrow Money App better than your average storefront lender or bank? There&#39;s no waiting in line or physical paperwork to fill out. Everything could be completed easily via the loan app without ever having to leave the couch.<br><br>If you want to borrow money instantly, this is about as close as you will get. Simply:<br><br>✅ Choose the desired loan amount<br>✅ Enter your basic details<br>✅ Share your bank details so the loan can be deposited in as fast as one working day<br><br>Using our money borrowing app is completely free. Having spent years seeing people struggle to borrow cash in the industry, we created this tool to do all the hard work for you.<br><br>Fill out one simple loan request form and we&#39;ll instantly attempt to connect you with a licensed direct lender, meaning you don&#39;t have to waste time and potential credit searches applying with lenders one by one!<br><br>You&#39;ll know onscreen if one of these lenders will offer you a loan and the full terms of the offer. It&#39;s up to you whether you click through and accept the offer. <br><br><b>Good news:</b> having bad credit doesn&#39;t automatically disqualify you. Lenders from our network are more concerned with your actual capacity to pay back the loan. Even if they conduct a credit check, they will evaluate your application fairly, as long as you fulfill the minimal requirements.<br><br>Material disclosure, rates, and fees<br><br>This payday loans app is not the lender. It is a specially designed loan app that aims to connect eligible borrowers with licensed lenders offering payday loans online. The app doesn’t charge potential borrowers for its use and any personal data submitted is only shared among participating lenders. It is not sold or shared with third parties and industry-standard encryption technology is used to keep data secure. Consumers are not obligated to accept a loan offer and are free to close the app and loan application at any time prior to digitally signing an agreement with a lender. By law, lenders are required to provide a full copy of the terms and conditions of any offer, such as the loan principal, fees, interests rates (APR), and repayment schedule prior to issuing the loan. The specific loan agreement terms can vary from lender to lender and state to state.<br><br>APR disclosure<br><br>The APR is the annual percentage rate charged for loans. It depends on how much you borrow, for how long, and the lender&#39;s policies. <b>Some states legally limit APRs, and they can range between 6.63% up to 35.99%</b>. Loan repayment terms vary depending on the loan amount, individual lender policies, and the type of loan. <b>Repayment terms range between 65 days to 3 years</b>. Failure to repay a loan can result in extra fees, interest, collection proceedings, and a hit to your credit score. <br><br>Below is a representative example of how APR might be calculated:<br><br>A loan of $1,000 taken out over a one-year period with a 20% APR will cost you:<br>- Total charge for loan: $1,000 * 0.20 (20% APR) = $200<br>- Total amount you&#39;ll repay: $1,000 + $200 = $1,200<br>- Monthly payment: $1,200 / 12 = $100<br><br>We thank you for using our Borrow Money App.",

    "summary": "Google Family Link is a parental controls app that helps you keep your family safer online. We know that every family’s relationship with technology is unique, so we designed tools like Family Link that give you the flexibility to choose the right balance for your family, and help them create healthy digital habits. Family Link’s easy to use tools allow you to understand how your child is spending time on their device, see their device location, manage privacy settings, and more.<br><br><br>  With Family Link, you can:<br><br>  <b>Establish Digital Ground Rules</b><br>  • Set screen time limits — Family Link lets you set downtime for your child’s device and time limits for apps, so you can help them find a healthy balance.<br>  • Guide them to age-appropriate content — Approve or block apps your child wants to download. Family Link also allows you to choose the right YouTube experience for your child: a supervised experience on YouTube, or YouTube Kids.<br><br>  <b>Manage and secure your child’s account</b><br>  • Protect their privacy — Permissions management in Family Link allow you to make meaningful choices about your child’s data. View and manage permissions for websites and extensions accessed through Chrome as well as apps downloaded on your child’s device.<br>  • Secure their account — Family Link gives you access to manage your child&#39;s account and data settings. As a parent, you can help change or reset your child’s password if they forget it, edit their personal information or even delete their account if you feel necessary.<br><br>  <b>Stay connected on the go</b><br>  • See where they are — It’s helpful to be able to find your family when they’re on the go. With Family Link, you can locate your children on one map, as long as they’re carrying their device.<br>  • Get notifications and alerts — Family Link delivers critical notifications including when your child arrives or leaves a certain location. You can also ring devices and view the device’s remaining battery life.<br><br><br>  <b>Important Information</b><br><br>  • Family Link’s tools vary depending on your child’s device. See a list of compatible devices at https://families.google/familylink/device-compatibility/<br>  • While Family Link helps you manage your child&#39;s purchases and downloads from Google Play, they will not need approval to install app updates (including updates that expand permissions), apps you have previously approved, or apps that have been shared in Family Library. In addition, purchase approvals will apply only when your child makes a purchase through Google Play’s billing system and will not apply to purchases made through alternate billing systems. Parents should regularly review their child’s installed apps and app permissions in Family Link.<br>  • You should carefully review the apps on your child’s supervised device and disable those you don’t want them to use. Note that you may not be able to disable some pre-installed apps such as Play, Google, etc.<br>  • To see the location of your child or teen’s device, the device must be powered on, recently active, and connected to the internet through data or wifi.<br>  • Family Link parental controls are only available for supervised Google accounts. With supervised Google Accounts, children get access to Google products like Search, Chrome, and Gmail, and parents can set up basic digital ground rules to supervise them.<br>  • While Family Link provides tools to manage your child’s online experience and keep them safer online, it does not make the internet safe. Family Link can not determine the content on the internet, but it can give parents the opportunity to make decisions about how their child spends time on their device, and determine what path to online safety looks best for your family.",

Let others know you are thinking of them when you send a GiftYa!<br><br>VIRTUAL GIFTS<br><br>Introducing GiftYa - the gift card app that allows you to send a gift card in a new way! From the makers of Giftcards.com, GifYa is an app that completely streamlines and simplifies the gift card gift-giving process!  We have reinvented gift sharing to be more accessible, personalized, and thoughtful than ever! Gift card apps are often hit-or-miss. You buy gift cards that either don’t work or get sent to the wrong email. With GiftYa, we&#39;ve made an app that ensures these irritating problems will never happen to you again! Become the ultimate e-gifter with GiftYa!<br><br>The process is simple. Connect your credit/debit card to GiftYa, and you can purchase gift cards (a GiftYa) and send them through text messages to your friends and family! Sending gift cards via email can lead to mistakes in delivery - phone numbers are easier to enter accurately and are less cluttered with messages. They are also more accessible for any technologically challenged people in your life. Anyone can receive a text and claim their gift card. Granny won’t have to reset her email password just to get her birthday gift this year! When you send someone mobile gift cards with GiftYa, they can link it to their credit/debit card in seconds. Once someone purchases with their linked card, GiftYa credits their account until they’ve spent the total amount in their GiftYa gift card wallet! Redeem GiftYa’s ANYWHERE you can use your card!<br><br>That’s the best part! With this method, a GiftYa is usable at ANY business. Gift cards aren&#39;t just for major chains anymore! You can use GiftYa to send giftcards to Starbucks or that small cafe down the road serving your friend&#39;s favorite chai latte. GiftYa is even more widely accepted than a Visa card! It is just that convenient!<br><br><br>SIMPLE GIFTS<br><br>Any occasion is a good time for a gift. Gift for whatever, whenever. Before, people bought gift cards for holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions. Now, you can send a GiftYa for as little as $5. If It’s the thought that counts, then let people know you are thinking of them! Know someone going for a job interview, send them a $5 GiftYa for a cup of coffee with a personalized Good Luck message. Congratulate that new grad with a quick GiftYa for whatever graduation shenanigans they have planned!

Other transactions including ACH Debit transactions are not eligible for coverage. Any negative balance must be repaid within thirty (30) days. Whether we authorize an overdraft is discretionary, and we reserve the right not to pay. For example, we typically will not pay overdrafts if you fail to meet the eligibility requirements for this service or you attempt too many transactions or transactions that create too large of an overdraft. Call us at 1-833-954-1605 or log in to your Online Account Center for additional terms and conditions that apply, including initial and ongoing eligibility requirements for the service.

Any negative balance must be repaid within thirty (30) days. Whether we authorize an overdraft is discretionary, and we reserve the right not to pay.

Call us at 1-833-954-0799 or log in to your Online Account Center for additional terms and conditions that apply, including initial and ongoing eligibility requirements for the service.
