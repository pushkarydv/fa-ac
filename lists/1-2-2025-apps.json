CA resident license #0172748.<br><br>ELIGIBILITY AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS; PERSONAL LOAN INTEREST RATES AND FEES. You can see personal loan offers on the Credit Karma personal loan marketplace from third party advertisers from which Credit Karma receives compensation. Credit Karma members are shown offers with Outstanding Approval Odds^ when available to them. Offers with Outstanding Approval Odds have rates that range from 3.86% APR to 35.99% APR with terms from 1 to 10 years. Rates are subject to change without notice and are controlled by our third party advertisers, not Credit Karma. Depending on the particular lender, other fees may apply, such as origination fees or late payment fees. See the particular lender&#39;s terms and conditions for additional details. All loan offers on Credit Karma require your application and approval by the lender. You may not qualify for a personal loan at all or you may not qualify for the lowest rates or the highest offer amounts.\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>PERSONAL LOAN REPAYMENT EXAMPLE. The following example assumes a $15,000 personal loan with a four year (48 month) term. For APRs ranging from 3.86% to 35.99%, monthly payments would range from $338 to $594. Assuming all of the 48 payments are made on-time, the total amount paid would range from $16,212 to $28,492.<br><br>^ Approval Odds are not a guarantee of approval. Credit Karma determines Approval Odds by comparing your credit profile to other Credit Karma members who were approved for the personal loan, or whether you meet certain criteria determined by the lender. Of course, there&#39;s no such thing as a sure thing, but knowing your Approval Odds may help you narrow down your choices. For example, you may not be approved because you don&#39;t meet the lender&#39;s &quot;ability to pay standard&quot; after they verify your income and employment; or, you already have the maximum number of accounts with that specific lender.",
