CA resident license #0172748.<br><br>ELIGIBILITY AND ADDITIONAL DETAILS; PERSONAL LOAN INTEREST RATES AND FEES. You can see personal loan offers on the Credit Karma personal loan marketplace from third party advertisers from which Credit Karma receives compensation. Credit Karma members are shown offers with Outstanding Approval Odds^ when available to them. Offers with Outstanding Approval Odds have rates that range from 3.86% APR to 35.99% APR with terms from 1 to 10 years. Rates are subject to change without notice and are controlled by our third party advertisers, not Credit Karma. Depending on the particular lender, other fees may apply, such as origination fees or late payment fees. See the particular lender&#39;s terms and conditions for additional details. All loan offers on Credit Karma require your application and approval by the lender. You may not qualify for a personal loan at all or you may not qualify for the lowest rates or the highest offer amounts.\t\t\t\t\t\t<br>PERSONAL LOAN REPAYMENT EXAMPLE. The following example assumes a $15,000 personal loan with a four year (48 month) term. For APRs ranging from 3.86% to 35.99%, monthly payments would range from $338 to $594. Assuming all of the 48 payments are made on-time, the total amount paid would range from $16,212 to $28,492.<br><br>^ Approval Odds are not a guarantee of approval. Credit Karma determines Approval Odds by comparing your credit profile to other Credit Karma members who were approved for the personal loan, or whether you meet certain criteria determined by the lender. Of course, there&#39;s no such thing as a sure thing, but knowing your Approval Odds may help you narrow down your choices. For example, you may not be approved because you don&#39;t meet the lender&#39;s &quot;ability to pay standard&quot; after they verify your income and employment; or, you already have the maximum number of accounts with that specific lender.",

It&#39;s up to you whether you click through and accept the offer. <br><br><b>Good news:</b> having bad credit doesn&#39;t automatically disqualify you. Lenders from our network are more concerned with your actual capacity to pay back the loan. Even if they conduct a credit check, they will evaluate your application fairly, as long as you fulfill the minimal requirements.<br><br>Material disclosure, rates, and fees<br><br>This payday loans app is not the lender. It is a specially designed loan app that aims to connect eligible borrowers with licensed lenders offering payday loans online. The app doesn‚Äôt charge potential borrowers for its use and any personal data submitted is only shared among participating lenders. It is not sold or shared with third parties and industry-standard encryption technology is used to keep data secure. Consumers are not obligated to accept a loan offer and are free to close the app and loan application at any time prior to digitally signing an agreement with a lender. By law, lenders are required to provide a full copy of the terms and conditions of any offer, such as the loan principal, fees, interests rates (APR), and repayment schedule prior to issuing the loan. The specific loan agreement terms can vary from lender to lender and state to state.<br><br>APR disclosure<br><br>The APR is the annual percentage rate charged for loans. It depends on how much you borrow, for how long, and the lender&#39;s policies. <b>Some states legally limit APRs, and they can range between 6.63% up to 35.99%</b>. Loan repayment terms vary depending on the loan amount, individual lender policies, and the type of loan. <b>Repayment terms range between 65 days to 3 years</b>. Failure to repay a loan can result in extra fees, interest, collection proceedings, and a hit to your credit score. <br><br>Below is a representative example of how APR might be calculated:<br><br>A loan of $1,000 taken out over a one-year period with a 20% APR will cost you:<br>- Total charge for loan: $1,000 * 0.20 (20% APR) = $200<br>- Total amount you&#39;ll repay: $1,000 + $200 = $1,200<br>- Monthly payment: $1,200 / 12 = $100<br><br>We thank you for using our Borrow Money App.",
